# threejs-examples
In this repository presented some examples which were done using 3D library [Three.js].

## Drinking Bird
The desription of what a drinking bird exactly is can be found [here]. This example is a result of ["Interactive 3D Graphics"] free online course on [Udacity.com].

## Earth and Sun 
The small solar system which includes only Earth, Moon and Sun. 

**Note:** All object's movements and physical phenomena are unreal.

## Geometric shapes
The project demonstrates the generation of geometric shapes and transitions between them. 
The generation of the shapes has been implemented by different mathematical formulas and the animation has been generated only through native [Three.js] objects, classes and their methods, so there is no [TweenJS] or something like that.
