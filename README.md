# threejs-examples
In this repository presented some examples which were done using 3D library [Three.js].

## Threejs Loader
Simple 3D Loader that was created with a combination of [Three.js] and [Greensock (GSAP)]. The loader was choosen as "Picked pens" by organizers of codepen.io ([How they choose?])

Codepen: https://codepen.io/egor-sorokin/pen/xXqyVY

Live demo: http://threejs-examples-egor.herokuapp.com/loader/


## Geometric shapes
This project demonstrates an initialisation of geometric shapes and transitions between them. 
The generation of the shapes has been implemented by different mathematical formulas and the animation has been generated only through native [Three.js] objects, classes and their methods, so there is no [TweenJS] or something like that.

## Drinking Bird
The description of what a drinking bird exactly is can be found [here]. This example is a result of ["Interactive 3D Graphics"] free online course on [Udacity.com].

## Earth and Sun 
A small solar system which includes only Earth, Moon and Sun. 

**Note:** All object's movements and physical phenomena are unreal.
